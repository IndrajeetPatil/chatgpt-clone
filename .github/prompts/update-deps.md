# Update Dependencies and Refactor Codebase

Run `make update-deps` to refresh backend uv dependencies, frontend pnpm
dependencies, and prek hook revisions. Then iterate until the full local quality
gate passes:

- `make qa`
- `make frontend-build`
- `make e2e-test`
- `make lighthouse`
- `make contrast-audit`
- `make docker-build`

Fix any breaking API changes, type errors, lockfile drift, Docker build
failures, coverage regressions, or lint failures introduced by the upgrades.

If the pnpm version changes, update the canonical declaration in:

- `frontend/package.json` (`packageManager`)

The GitHub workflows read pnpm from `frontend/package.json` via
`pnpm/action-setup`'s `package_json_file` input, and `.devcontainer/post-create.sh`
derives the installed pnpm version from the same field. Do not add or reintroduce
hard-coded pnpm versions in workflow files.

If the Node.js version changes, update every runtime declaration together:

- `frontend/.nvmrc`
- `frontend/Dockerfile` (`node:<version>-trixie-slim`)
- `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`
  (`ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/node` `version`)

The GitHub workflows read Node from `frontend/.nvmrc`; do not add a separate
hard-coded workflow Node version unless the workflow design changes.

If the Python version changes, update every backend runtime declaration together:

- `backend/pyproject.toml` (`requires-python`)
- `backend/uv.lock` (`requires-python`)
- `backend/Dockerfile` (`python:<version>-slim-trixie`)

If the uv version changes, update the canonical declaration in:

- `backend/pyproject.toml` (`[tool.uv]` `required-version`)
- `backend/Dockerfile` (update the `uv` image tag and its `@sha256:` digest)
- `.devcontainer/post-create.sh` (update the `uv-installer.sh` SHA checksum)

The GitHub workflows read uv from `backend/pyproject.toml` via
`astral-sh/setup-uv`'s `working-directory` input, and `.devcontainer/post-create.sh`
derives the installed uv version from the same field. Do not mirror that version
into workflow files.

For any other third-party tools updated (e.g., Trivy in
`.github/workflows/docker-compose.yml`), ensure their downloaded scripts or
binaries are still pinned to specific versions and their SHA256 checksums are
updated to match the new version.

`make update-deps` runs `prek update --freeze`, which refreshes each prek hook to
its latest tag but records the resolved **commit SHA** in `rev` with a
`# frozen: <tag>` comment. Keep the hooks in `prek.toml` pinned this way — the
same SHA-pinning convention the repo uses for GitHub Actions. Never rewrite a
frozen `rev` back to a bare mutable tag.

Do an online search and ensure that the public GitHub Actions used in
`.github/workflows/` are still on the latest stable release. Actions are pinned
by full commit SHA with a `# vX.Y.Z` comment; when updating, replace both the SHA
and the version comment with the latest stable release.

Once the dependency update is green, review relevant changelogs and current
documentation for upgraded libraries. Apply small compatibility simplifications
only when they reduce local complexity or remove a workaround, and rerun the
affected checks after each change.

Make a draft PR using the gh CLI, instead of the GitHub MCP server. In the PR
body, summarise dependency groups changed, compatibility fixes made, validation
commands that passed, and any key refactorings as list items.
